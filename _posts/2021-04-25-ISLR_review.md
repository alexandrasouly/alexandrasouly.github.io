Are you also constantly wondering what to learn next?  

 A couple of months ago, I felt that my Machine Learning foundations were a bit too shaky. I wanted to start Kaggle, but I was too intimidated by all the available techniques to use. I wanted to change this as efficiently as possible, and I did. I have found a solution to both of my problems, and I'm excited to share it with you! 

In this article, I will share my experiences working through the textbook Introduction to Statistical Learning in R (abbreviated as ISLR). I hope this helps you figure out whether you should pick it up too, and I'll also share some tips to make your studies more efficient.

### Why I picked ISLR

I have started my Machine Learning journey about a year ago - when lockdown boredom set in, I worked through Andrew Ng's famous [Machine learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). While I have loved the course and it gave me a foundation to work with, I felt like I needed more knowledge about how to use the newfound knowledge in a practical way. I wanted to learn more  techniques like random forests, be more informed about when to use which algorithm, and how to actually implement them in Python. I was looking to start Kaggle, so I decided to do the [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) courses. I got discouraged fairly quickly, when one of the first Kaggle Learn tutorials was about implementing a decision tree, but didn't explain what it was or how it worked under the hood. After half an hour of frantic searching and reading a lot of blog posts not really explaining anything, I decided I needed something where knowledge was more detailed and organized - a textbook. 

When picking the textbook, I was looking for the following:
- Introductory/undergrad level, easy to follow and not intended for PhD students
- Goes into details of the Maths, but explains intuition as well
- Introduces lots of different ML techniques Ng's course didn't cover
- Practical, has coding exercises to implement what I have learnt 
- Can be completed within 2-3 months

After some Reddit deep dives (go join [r/learnmachinelearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/)), I found that the most recommended intro book seemed to be ISLR. It also satisfied all the requirements I was looking for, so I gave it a go.

### All about ISLR

The good thing about this book is that it's freely available to download from the [authors' website](https://www.statlearning.com/). You can just take a peek and decide whether you like it or not before committing to an expensive textbook. However, I do recommend getting a physical copy for working through it.

As the title says, ISLR introduces Statistical Learning techniques with examples and exercises in R. But what is Statical Learning? The book defines it as a "vast set of tools for *understanding data*" In general there is a fight going on between Statistics and ML, you can read about it in [this very entertaining post](http://brenocon.com/blog/2008/12/statistics-vs-machine-learning-fight/). Concerning this book, there is a slight cultural difference to usual ML resources, sometimes different terminologies (e.g. "Lasso/Ridge" instead of "L1/L2"), some focus on classical Statistics concepts (like p-values and hypothesis testing), but it mostly explains methods you could usually classify as ML algorithms, such as regression, SVMs, tree-based methods and unsupervised learning concepts. 

This book was designed to be accessible to people from different industries and backgrounds, who need to work with data in their profession without necessarily having university-level Maths education.
The book does not assume more mathematical background than an introductory Maths course, it doesn't use matrix or vector notation to keep things simple. It also doesn't assume any previous R experience, and carefully explains every line of code, including writing functions and making plots. 


ISLR is split into 10 Chapters, starting with an introductory chapter explaining the notation, bias/variance trade-off, and introducing R. 
After the first chapter, all further chapters are around a selected technique, slowly building up from Linear Regression to more complicated concepts, such as Random Forests and Hierarchical Clustering. Every chapter has Labs at the end that guide you through implementing the methods taught in the chapter, and further conceptual and coding exercises to deepen your understanding.

In every chapter, the focus is on a high-level understanding of the concept and good intuition. I found that the amount of detail was sufficient for what I needed the book for, to confidently use the implementation of a method in my own projects. It compares similar methods by listing pros and cons, and gives examples when one method would be better over another method. The authors are illustrating every method with simple datasets and plausible real-life examples, which further help with intuition. I have particularly liked the colorful plots and graphs on nearly every page - whenever something new is explained, there is a plot for illustrating the concept on data.

### Who is ISLR recommended for?

I think you would definitely get a lot of value out of reading the book, if any of the following applies: 

- you want one single source of information to explain the basics of the most popular ML methods instead of spending loads of time searching for relevant articles and tutorials of varying quality
- you want to do Kaggle, but feel intimidated by all the available ML methods to use on your data
- you know how the algorithms work in theory, but don't know how to start implementing them
- you want a preparatory textbook that explains intuition, before jumping into the Maths heavy grad-level textbooks
- you want to remind yourself of the Maths behind algorithms before Data Science interviews. The material in this book was very helpful (and sufficient) for several Data Scientist grad job interview online rounds according to some of my friends.

### Some tips 

#### Porting  ISLR to Python  
This book is in R, and lots of people (including me) don't use R for their data science projects. However, if you are Team Python like me, this book is still amazing. You can read it and take on a challenge: solve the labs in Python instead.

This gives you a framework to practice the theoretical concepts by following the exercises, but with less hand-holding: you can't just retype the R code to complete the labs, you have to first figure out how to do them. This will mean getting deep into Numpy, scikit-learn and StatsModels library documentation, and understanding the parameters in each function to get the same behavior as in R. In all honesty, doing this provided me with at least as much benefit as reading the book did. 

The good thing is, if you are stuck you can always just look up someone else's solution, as many people have already done this. (Here's [my GitHub repo with the Python labs](https://github.com/alexandrasouly/ISLR-but-python), but you can always just google "ISLR in Python" and find a dozen other repos.)

#### Certified online course + videos
I prefer books to videos, but we are all different.
If you learn better from videos, you don't have to worry - the authors have recorded a course based on this book to supplement your reading. 
The 15 hours Youtube playlist is linked from [here](https://www.dataschool.io/15-hours-of-expert-machine-learning-videos/).  
If you get more motivated by working towards a certificate that you can purchase to show it on your CV, that option also exists. Stanford offers the course [here on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-learning), with additional exercises and feedback if you decide to purchase the certificate. 


#### Time frame
If you want to keep yourself accountable, here's an estimate how you could set yourself goals to finish the book:
- I estimate the book can be finished in 10 weeks, with about 5-6 hours of work per week (8-10 if you are porting to Python by yourself)
- Going through the text of a chapter takes about 2 hours if you are taking notes, half an hour for the conceptual exercises, one hour for the lab in R (or up to 4 in Python for me), and 1-2 hours for the coding exercises. Of course there are shorter and longer chapters, but this is my rough estimate for the average.

Working through a textbook alone can be a bit demotivating - no reminders and red pop-ups like on online courses. I recommend you set yourself a goal for finishing each chapter by some specified date to keep yourself motivated. This is such a popular book that you can probably find some accountability buddies on Reddit too.

### What to do next?

If you have finished the book, you should feel a bit more comfortable applying Machine Learning methods to solve your chosen problems. You are probably ready to start experimenting with datasets and practicing on Kaggle if you're interested. I recommend starting out with the [Tabular Playground Series](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-apr-2021) if you are looking for a gentle competition experience. These datasets are easy to work with, don't take up a lot of computational resources and perfect for trying out various simple models. I can wholeheartedly recommend the article [Progressively approaching Kaggle by Rohan Rao](https://towardsdatascience.com/progressively-approaching-kaggle-f58db71a42a9) if you would like to know more on that.

If you just can't get enough of the Maths you've learnt in ISLR and have a solid foundation on Linear Algebra and Calculus, I recommend you go and check out [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)(ESL). ISLR is technically the introductory book to ESL, which goes into the Maths *a lot more*, and is intended more to be a reference book for PhD students and researchers than something you just read through.

Whatever you decide to do next, I hope you found this review useful, and I wish you good luck on your Machine Learning journey!
