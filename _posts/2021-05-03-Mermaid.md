## Live editor

## Vscode
Markdown Preview Mermaid support
```html
    ```mermaid
    ```
```
## Github pages/Websites:
You can't use plugin on Github pages 
You could render it locally each time and push the code for it, but that's painful
instead, you could do this:
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mermaid/8.0.0/mermaid.min.js"></script>
in your header.html
or download the file, put it somewhere locally and source from there

Then define your chart like this:
```html
<div class="mermaid">
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
</div>
```
## jekyll sites:
https://github.com/jasonbellamy/jekyll-mermaid

## Javascript packages yarn
yarn add mermaid
## On gitlab
just works
## Anywhere else
Browser extension. OFC doesn't work if someone doesn't have it
Convert to pic and save it
## Maintainability 
you can diff it and it's really nice
