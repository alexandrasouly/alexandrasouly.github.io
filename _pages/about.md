Hi there! 
Welcome to my blog, I'm Alexandra. When I'm working, I'm a Software Engineer at Microsoft Cloud & AI, working on telecommunication solutions.

This is my tiny corner of the internet where I write about my hobby learning projects, mostly in Machine Learning, Statistics and Technology. These are mostly written with the purpose of consolidating my own understanding and practicing technical communication, but I'd very happy if you found something helpful!

As you can see, I have only started writing recently, so there is no much content yet. But watch this space! I spend a lot of time learning exciting things, and I can't wait to see what this little project grows into. 

If you like my writings, please connect with me on LinkedIn or leave a comment, I'd be delighted to hear from you!
